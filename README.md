A static WordPress site generated with the [Simply Static](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/) plugin and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). A hosted-for-free website with custom domain and SSL. How cool is that? Thanks GitHub and Simply Static.

You can do this too. Here's the idea:

1. Run WordPress locally with [Local](<https://localwp.com>), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) or similar
2. Install Simply Static and set it to generate files in a local directory (your local repo)
3. Generate files then push up the local repo to your remote repo
4. Setup GitHub Pages to use your repo, and you'll probably want to use your domain too

This is great for small personal sites but note there is a 1 GB storage limit with GitHub Pages and you may also want to check out [Simply Static Pro](https://simplystatic.com) which makes it easier to deploy to GitHub or other services that offer more storage (no shame in paying for something, you know).
